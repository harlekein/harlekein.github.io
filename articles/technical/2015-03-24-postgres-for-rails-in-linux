<p>This will be very short to let you know how to set up PostgreSQL so you won't have to use a password. Obviously this isn't the most secure, but this is assuming you don't have sensitive data in your development and test environment. (Which you shouldn't have.)</p>

<p>There is an excellent guide on how to set up Postgres on Ubuntu. I use Linux Mint, but 95% of the time an Unbuntu how-to will work on Linux Mint every time. If you haven't done that yet, go do that first:</p>

<h3>Minimal configuration</h3>
<p>So what I want for my Rails projects is a postgresql setup which will create the databases I need and be compatible with people I work on projects with who probably use a Mac.</p>
<p>This is what my database.yml file would look like:</p>
<pre class="highlight ruby"><code>&#x000A;<span class="ss">default: </span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">default</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ss">adapter: </span><span class="n">postgresql</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ss">encoding: </span><span class="n">unicode</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ss">pool: </span><span class="mi">5</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="ss">development:&#x000A;  </span><span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">default</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ss">database: </span><span class="n">project_name_development</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;<span class="ss">test:&#x000A;  </span><span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">default</span>&#x000A;  <span class="ss">database: </span><span class="n">project_name_test</span>&#x000A;&#x000A;</code></pre>
<p>Now with Postgres installed and the configuration set up there was one thing that kept bugging me and it took me some Google searches, visits to StackOverflow and some trial and error before I got it right. So here it is:</p>
<h3>The point of this post</h3>
<p>This is where you should go: <span class='inline-code'>/etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf</span></p>
<p>Then I simply added this line:</p>
<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code># TYPE  DATABASE     USER          ADDRESS            METHOD&#x000A;host    all          richard       127.0.0.1/32       trust&#x000A;</code></pre>
<p>This means that for user 'richard' I set a blank password and now allow all connections which I run from Rails. That's it really. Nice and easy.</p>
